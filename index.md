## Radiomics

### <span style="color:orange"> What is Radiomics?  </span>

**Radiomics** is a field of medical study that aims to extract large amount of quantitative features from medical images using data-characterisation algorithms.[1][2][3][4][5] These features, termed radiomic features, have the potential to uncover disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eye.[6] The hypothesis of radiomics is that the distinctive imaging features between disease forms may be useful for predicting prognosis and therapeutic response for various conditions, thus providing valuable information for personalised therapy.[1][1][7][8] Radiomics emerged from the medical field of oncology[3] and is the most advanced in applications within that field. However, the technique can be applied to any medical study where a disease or a condition can be tomographically imaged.
